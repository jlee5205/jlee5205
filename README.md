## Jui Hsin (Vincent) Lee

### Formal Background
Hello, my name is Vincent! I recently graduated from Binghamton University with a degree in Computer Science in May 2025. Iâ€™m currently seeking full-time software engineering opportunities starting in 2025. 

While I am still searching, I am currently a research assistant with Professor Yu David Liu at Binghamton University. My research is about characterizing behavior in applications, such as energy, carbon, and temperature, providing insight into sustainable computing. I work and learn from a lot of smart people in my group, so it's super exciting. You can check out my current project here: [jcarbon](https://github.com/project-jcarbon/jcarbon).

### Casual Background
I enjoy hiking and cooking yummy foods a lot. I also make videos online (I vlogged once a year for all 4 years of college!).

I also like art, particularly pieces from the Impressionist movement. My two favorite works are [The Garden of the Tuileries on a Winter Afternoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_the_Tuileries_on_a_Winter_Afternoon) and [Landscape with Flock of Sheep](https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1964.24), both by by Camille Pissarro. 

### Contact Information
The easiest way to reach me is by email: **jlee808@binghamton.edu**.  
You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jui-hsin-lee/) â€” Iâ€™m always happy to connect! 

PS: This README is loosely inspired by my mentor Timur.
